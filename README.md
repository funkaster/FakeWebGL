# What is this?

This is the WebGL layer that Apple didn't want you to use :)

In reallity, it's a very thin, non-secure WebGL implementation. This has no
knowledge of DOM or anything related. You can think of this as
[Ejecta](http://impactjs.com/ejecta) but for WebGL.

UPDATE: Ejecta now actually has a WebGL mode, so you can think of this as
Ejecta, for WebGL and written in C++ instead of Objective-C, and also using
Spidermonkey instead of JavaScriptCore. The fact that is written in C++ and
using Spidermonkey means that this (sometime in the near future) will run also
on Android.

## Non-secure?

When I say non-secure I mean that I'm not doing the same type-checking or
verification process that your browser is doing when evaluating WebGL code. I
assume you know what you're doing, and basically that the JS code that you're
running is safe.

## What works?

Right now this works:

* up to [lesson 5](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=507) of the
  [WebGL lessons](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217)
* touch input
* PNG support (non-compressed PNGs)
* XMLHttpRequest, sort of... just working for local requests, and it's non-async
  :)

Not working:

* sound (HTML5 Sound API-like in the works)
* js debugger (in the works)
* proper retina support

## Will this work in the iOS store?

I'm not Apple, but AFAIK, this complies will all the requirements. I'm using a
non-jitted Spidermonkey version for the JS engine. This is better than using
JavaScriptCore, because the license in JSC would require you to release your
`.o` files to the public. Spidermonkey is released under the Mozilla Public
License, which is more reasonable.

## Can I help?

Yes please!

If you want, you can keep adding WebGL/OpenGL-ES methods to the code, just look
into `WebGLRenderingContext.cpp` and `WebGLRenderingContext.hpp`. It should be
really straight-forward.

## How can I add my own classes to javascript?

That also should be easy. Just look at the implementation of the
TestClass. There are several macros there that will help you go through it. At
some point I'll write documentation :) - Although I keep saying that all the
time...
